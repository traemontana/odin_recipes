<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Bolognese is a kind of ragu, originally from Bologna, Italy. It's very different from your usual american meat sauce, often a tomato-based sauce simmered with ground beef. Bolognese is a much thicker,creamier, and with just a touch of tomato. It also happens to be one of my favorite pastas.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>2 large carrots</li>
    <li>3 celery ribs</li>
    <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>3 pounds ground chuck brisket</li>
    <li>2 cups of tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 cups of red wine</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>3 bay leaves</li>
    <li>Spaghetti</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps for <em>Perfect</em> Bolognese</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a food processor, puree onion, carrots, celery, and garlic into a coarse paste. In a large pan over medium heat, coat pan with oil. Add the pureed veggies and season generously with salt. Bring the pan to a medium-high heat and cook until all the water has evaporated and they become nice and brown, stirring frequently, about 15 to 20 minutes. Be patient, this is where the big flavors develop.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and season again generously with salt. BROWN THE BEEF! Brown food tastes good. Don't rush this step. Cook another 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato paste and cook until brown about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the red wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, another 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Boom perfect bolognese</li>
</ol>
