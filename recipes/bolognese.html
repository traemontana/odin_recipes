<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Bolognese is a kind of ragu, originally from Bologna, Italy. It's very different from your usual american meat sauce, often a tomato-based sauce simmered with ground beef. Bolognese is a much thicker,creamier, and with just a touch of tomato. It also happens to be one of my favorite pastas.</p>
